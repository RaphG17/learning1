        Independence Day in India occurs on August 15 of every year. It celebrates the date in 1947 when the Indian
        Independence Act came into effect, which established India and Pakistan as separate countries, no longer
        under British imperialist rule. (In Pakistan, Independence Day is celebrated on August 14th.)

        The British continued to expand their influence in the region until, by the mid nineteenth century, they had
        control over most of what is present-day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. In 1857, a rebellion in northern India
        by mutinous Indian soldiers, led the British Government to transfer all political power from the East India
        Company to the Crown. The British began controlling most of India directly while administering the rest through
        treaties with local rulers.
